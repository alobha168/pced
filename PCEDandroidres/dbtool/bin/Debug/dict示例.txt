looka: 1 示例文本，可删除This term is probably used for the first time in Abh. S., though already in Vis.M. XIV the 4 <i>cetasika</i> in question are mentioned amongst the mental factors associated with each of the 12 <i>akusala-cittas</i> (Tab. I, 22-33), while in the <i>Abhidhamma</i> <i>Piṭaka</i> (Dhs. §§ 365-429) <i>uddhacca</i> is found only in the last of the 12 <i>cittas</i> , missing in all the remaining 11 <i>cittas</i> .
